I have been graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and a MS in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology. PhD student at the University of Sherbrooke, my research focuses on understanding the neural representation of an auditory stimulus in the brain. My goal is to study the features of the background auditory noise represented in the auditory system and use this in speech enhancement/biomedical applications. 

### More Information

I am fascinated by the human brain. I would love to understand it deeper and use this understanding to build devices that can help people live better.
